title: Method Calls
---

Ghost is deeply object oriented, so most code consists of invoking methods on objects, usually something like this:

```javascript
dog.speak("Throw the ball!");
```

You have a _receiver_ expression (here `dog`) followed by a `.`, then a name (`speak`) and an argument list in parentheses (`("Throw the ball!")`). Multiple arguments are separated by commas:

```javascript
dog.command("fetch", "ball");
```

The argument list can also be empty:

```javascript
dog.sit();
```

The VM executes a method call like so:

1. Evaluate the receiver and arguments from left to right.
2. Look up the method on the receiver's class.
3. Invoke it, psasing in the argument values.
