title: Maps

Maps â€” sometimes called _associative arrays_, _hashes_, or _dictionaries_ in other programming languages, store a collection of key-value pairings. Maps are constructed as a comma-separated list of key-value pairs enclosed by curly braces. Each key-value pair uses a colon to differentiate between the key and the value.

```dart
{
    "name": "Ghost",
    "value": 57.3,
    "handler": function(x) { x * x}
}
```
